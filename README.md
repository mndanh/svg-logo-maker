## Description

The purpose of of this project was to allow a user to input information via inquirer to answer the prompted questions and render out a logo in SVG form. and Jest if you would like to test.

## Installation

To install my project, a user will have to make sure they're running inquirer version 8.2.4. You can do this through your terminal by entering npm i inquirer@8.2.4. You will also need to run jest as a dev dependency by entering npm i --save-dev jest into your terminal.

## Usage

To use my application, you're going to have to open a terminal with all dependencies installed. In that terminal, run node index.js to start with the question prompts. Go through the questions one-by-one and press enter when completed with each. At the end, an logo.svg file will be rendered with the outputed code of the desired shape, text, and colors that were entered into the prompts. You can right click and 'Preview SVG' to see the rendering of that image. To run a test through jest, enter 'npm run test' in the terminal and you will see the tests successful output.
